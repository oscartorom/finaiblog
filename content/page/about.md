While I try to focus in economics/finance, implementing a project needs many skills that can be learnt while doing.
I would even go a step further and say that this is a data oriented blog with some finance; however, we cross the line between both worlds constantly, sometimes I'll even jump into different worlds.

So, if you are in the finance space, in the data science, or want to learn from both worlds, this is the place for you
I usually don't limit myself to a single tool, but a set of tools (which are usually, data-science tools). So you will see that the content will fluctuate between (list might increase if I learn something new):

- R
- Python
- SQL
- PowerBI, PowerApps, and the whole great infrastructure that the [Power Platform brings](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-au/)
- Excel (widely hated, still useful)

Finally, I try to makes things simple while showing the map. As this is created and generated with [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/), you can check my [github](https://github.com/oscartorom) to see the code behind everything (R code mostly).
